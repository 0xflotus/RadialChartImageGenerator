## Overview

### Why care about radial progress charts?
* Clearly, Apple likes radial progress charts which are used in their activity monitor health watch app.

* Radial charts are just the right way to display a large amount of data on such a small screen size.

* We as humans have been trained to read radial progress charts from a very young age - clocks. That's why they make a lot of sense to use on a watch.



Good luck creating hundreds of images
